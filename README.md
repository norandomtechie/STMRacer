Go retro with this car racing game!

# Introduction
Get to the checkpoint while racing past obstacles with your car! You play the game using a steering wheel as the car moves forward on its own, as you steer to avoid obstacles. The longer you remain in the game, the higher your score!

# Parts (tentative)
* STM32F0Discovery evaluation board
* Large LED display with multiple programmable individual LEDs
* Steering wheel (or similar cheaper accessible mechanism)
